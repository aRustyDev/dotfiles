# Commit Message Related Tooling

## Feature Requests / Ideas

- Make "scope" declarative and vet-able
  - `feat(isScope)` would be valid
  - `feat(notDeclared)` would be invalid
- Make "Conventional Commits" user friendly and declarative, so when the error
  occurs its easy to debug. ie `new(scope)` would be wrong, but instead of
  having to go to the conventional commit site, it would just output all
  "VALID" scopes and types.
