## Feature Requests and Ideas

- Identify commands/packages that don't have "completion" entries
  - Follow on by enabling `gh-cli` code-searches to find related issues
  - ie, "they don't exist", "they aren't robust", "they aren't to standard"
- Count Lines of Code (LOC)
- Identify and centralized TODOs from across the codebase
- Make the whole codebase searchable, and indexed
- Make converters for JSON -> SQL (to support SQLite and DuckDB)
- Make converters for JSON -> Kuzu/Graph
- Make validators for all JSON files & output files
- Make unit tests to support justfiles
- Validators to determine "coverage" of the dotfiles; ie what isn't being vetted
