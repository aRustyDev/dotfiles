🏁 Final Verdict

### **Most Complementary to SimpleCheckList:**

1. **Workflows MCP Server** - Adds orchestration layer that SimpleCheckList lacks
2. **Task Manager MCP** - Adds AI intelligence that SimpleCheckList lacks

### **Most Redundant with SimpleCheckList:**

1. **Task Orchestrator MCP (108yen)** - Too basic, overlaps with SimpleCheckList's CRUD
2. **Todoist/Jira MCP** - Different storage, but similar task tracking paradigm

### **Best Stack Recommendation:**

```/dev/null/recommended-stack.txt#L1-8
1. SimpleCheckList    - Visual task management + Web UI
2. Workflows MCP      - Multi-step workflow orchestration
3. Memory (Graphiti)  - Long-term context and knowledge
4. Task Manager MCP   - AI-powered PRD → Task conversion

Why this works:
- SimpleCheckList: Human interface for task tracking
- Workflows: Automate complex multi-step processes
- Memory: Remember why tasks were created
- Task Manager: Intelligent task breakdown from requirements
```

This combination gives you **structure (SimpleCheckList)**, **intelligence (Task Manager)**, **automation (Workflows)**, and **memory (Graphiti)** - covering all bases for AI-assisted development workflows!
