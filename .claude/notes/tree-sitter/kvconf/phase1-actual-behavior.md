# Phase 1 Actual Behavior (Commit 33ee00a)

## Date: 2025-08-31

### What Actually Works in Phase 1

1. **Basic Parsing**
   - `KEY=VALUE` (no spaces allowed)
   - Full line comments: `# This is a comment`
   - Empty values: `KEY=`
   - All values parse as generic `value` nodes

2. **Identifiers**
   - Basic pattern: `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*`
   - Namespace pattern: `@scope:key`

3. **Syntax Highlighting**
   - Keys (identifiers) → red
   - Values → green
   - Equals sign → cyan
   - Full line comments → grey

### What Does NOT Work (Expected)

1. **Spacing Around Equals**
   - `KEY = VALUE` → Causes ERROR nodes
   - Parser requires `KEY=VALUE` (no spaces)
   - Our fix is in local branch only

2. **Inline Comments**
   - `KEY=value # comment` → Comment becomes part of value
   - Shows as green (part of value) not grey (comment)
   - This is expected - inline comment support not implemented

3. **Error Detection**
   - `KEY===value` → Extra `=` signs become part of value
   - No error nodes generated for malformed syntax
   - Error handling planned for later phases

4. **Value Types**
   - No differentiation between strings, numbers, booleans, URLs
   - Everything is a generic `value` node
   - Type parsing planned for Phase 2+

### Highlighting Behavior Explained

When you see:
- **White/no highlighting** → Parser error (can't parse the line)
- **Green comments** → Parser thinks it's part of the value
- **Green `===`** → Parser includes it in the value

This is all expected behavior for the current parser version.

### Key Takeaway

The parser at commit `33ee00a` is very basic:
- Strict `KEY=VALUE` format only
- No spacing flexibility  
- No inline comments
- No error recovery
- No type differentiation

Our local improvements (spacing support) exist but aren't in the remote commit being used by Zed.
