# Phase 4 Checkpoint Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. URI/URL Grammar Implementation ✅
- Added `url` rule for http(s) URLs with support for:
  - Basic URLs: `https://example.com`
  - Userinfo: `https://user:pass@example.com`
  - Ports: `http://localhost:8080`
  - Paths: `https://api.example.com/v1/users`
  - Query parameters: `https://search.com?q=hello&page=1`
  - Fragments: `https://docs.com/guide#section`

- Added `uri` rule for other schemes:
  - Database: postgresql, mysql, mongodb, redis, jdbc
  - File: file, ftp, ftps, sftp
  - VCS: git, git+ssh, git+https, ssh
  - Messaging: amqp, amqps, mqtt, kafka, ws, wss
  - Cloud: s3, gs, azure
  - Other: mailto, data, ldap, ldaps, urn

### 2. Test Coverage ✅
- Created comprehensive test corpus with 22 URL/URI test cases
- All tests passing except known Phase 3 limitations

### 3. Syntax Highlighting ✅
- Added highlights for URLs and URIs: `@string.special.url`
- URLs/URIs should appear distinct from raw values in Zed

### 4. Verification Files ✅
- Created phase4-test.env with extensive examples
- Created phase4-verification.env for Zed testing

## Not Implemented (Deferred)

### Error Node Types
The Phase 4 plan included specific error node types, but these were not implemented because:
1. Tree-sitter's built-in error recovery is handling most cases
2. Would require significant grammar restructuring
3. Better suited for Phase 5 edge case handling

## Test Results

```
✅ 72 tests passing
❌ 3 known failures (Phase 3 decimal/scientific notation)
```

## Parsing Examples

```env
# URLs (parsed as url node)
API=https://api.example.com/v1
AUTH=https://user:token@github.com/repo.git

# URIs (parsed as uri node)  
DB=postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
BUCKET=s3://my-bucket/path/to/file

# Not URLs (parsed as raw_value)
DOMAIN=example.com
PATH=/usr/local/bin
```

## Known Issues Remain

1. **Decimal numbers**: `3.14` still parses as int(3) + error + int(14)
2. **Inline comments**: Still consumed by raw_value
3. **Key highlighting**: `NOT_INT=123abc` key may appear white

## Commit Information

- Hash: `eac352918a61abf574ae92a24f7c7ef30bc8241c`
- Branch: `feature/typed-values`
- Zed extension updated with new hash

## Next Steps

Phase 5 will focus on:
- Edge case handling
- Performance optimization
- Potentially addressing the key highlighting bug
- Error recovery improvements
