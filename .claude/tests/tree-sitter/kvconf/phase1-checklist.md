# Phase 1 Verification Checklist

## Parser Functionality
- [x] Basic KEY=VALUE parsing works
- [x] Comments are parsed correctly (# comments)
- [x] Empty values are handled (KEY=)
- [x] Identifiers support letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens
- [x] Namespace identifiers work (@scope:key)
- [ ] Spacing support (KEY = VALUE) - Note: Not in commit 33ee00a

## Zed Extension Integration
- [x] Extension compiles without errors
- [x] Extension loads in Zed
- [x] Syntax highlighting works:
  - [x] Keys/identifiers show in red
  - [x] Values show in green
  - [x] Equals sign shows in cyan
  - [x] Comments show in grey
- [x] File associations work:
  - [x] .env files
  - [x] .conf files
  - [x] .envrc files
  - [x] .example, .local, .test extensions

## Test Infrastructure
- [x] Test directory structure created
- [x] Validation script works (validate-fixtures.js)
- [x] Regression test script works (regression-test.js)
- [x] Test runner created (run-tests.js)
- [x] Comprehensive test fixtures created

## Build Process
- [x] Grammar generates without errors
- [x] WASM builds successfully
- [x] Parser can be tested via CLI
- [x] Extension can be synced with parser

## Documentation
- [x] Phase 1 lessons learned documented
- [x] Zed extension integration guide created
- [x] Grammar cleanup needs documented
- [x] Future phase plans updated with lessons

## Known Limitations (Expected)
- All values parse as generic strings (no type differentiation yet)
- No string interpolation support
- No boolean/integer type recognition
- Some test files fail due to format-specific features

## Notes
- Currently using commit 33ee00a from remote (doesn't include spacing support)
- Feature branch changes are local only
- Need to push branch or merge to master for full functionality
