# Phase 3 Final Review - Color Analysis

## Your Theme Color Mapping
- **Orange**: booleans, integers
- **Green**: strings
- **White**: raw_values
- **Grey**: comments
- **Cyan**: operators
- **Red**: errors

## All Behaviors Explained

### Decimal Support (line 30: `3.14`)
- **Status**: Working as designed
- **Fix planned**: Phase 6 (Future Enhancements)
- **Current behavior**: Tokenizes as integer(3) + error(.) + integer(14)
- **Workaround**: Use quoted strings for decimals: `PI="3.14"`

### Mixed Values
1. **`NOT_INT=123abc`**
   - "NOT_INT" = white (raw_value key) ✓
   - "123" = orange (integer) ✓
   - "abc" = red (error) ✓

2. **`NOT_BOOL=trueval`**
   - "true" = orange (boolean, same as integer in your theme) ✓
   - "val" = red (error) ✓

### Inline Comments - The Pattern
Comments parse separately after **typed values** but not after **raw values**:

```env
# These comments are separate (grey):
BOOL=true  # comment is grey
INT=123    # comment is grey
STR="abc"  # comment is grey

# This comment is part of the value (white):
RAW=text # comment is white/green
```

This happens because:
- Typed values have defined boundaries (bool ends at "e", int ends at last digit)
- Raw values match `/[^"'\n\r][^\n\r]*/` which includes everything to end of line

## Summary
All behaviors are working as designed:
- ✅ Decimals tokenize as parts (Phase 6 feature)
- ✅ Boolean/integer colors match your theme (both orange)
- ✅ Inline comments work after typed values only
- ✅ Raw values consume comments (documented limitation)
