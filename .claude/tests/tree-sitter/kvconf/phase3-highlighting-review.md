# Phase 3 Highlighting Review

**Date**: 2025-09-01
**Reviewer**: User

## Summary

Most highlighting behavior is working as expected, with documented limitations being correctly displayed. One potential issue identified with boolean color mapping.

## Observed Behavior

### ✅ Working as Expected

1. **Scientific Notation** (line 31: `6.022e23`)
   - Tokenized as parts: integer + error + identifier
   - Documented limitation in KNOWN_ISSUES.md

2. **Decimal Numbers** (line 30: `3.14`)
   - Tokenized as: integer + error + integer
   - Documented limitation in KNOWN_ISSUES.md

3. **Mixed Alphanumeric** (line 18: `123abc`)
   - "123" highlighted as integer (orange)
   - "abc" highlighted as error (red)
   - Documented tokenization limitation

4. **Case-Sensitive Booleans** (line 16: `TrUe`)
   - Highlighted as raw_value (green)
   - Correct: only lowercase "true/false" are booleans

5. **Signed Integers** (line 12: `+99`)
   - Highlighted as integer (orange)
   - Correct implementation

6. **Inline Comments in Raw Values** (phase1 line 29)
   - Comment text included in value (green)
   - Documented limitation for raw values only

7. **URLs Not Yet Implemented** (phase1 lines 38, 50)
   - URLs shown as raw_value (green)
   - Correct: URL support planned for Phase 4/5

### ⚠️ Potential Issue

1. **Boolean in Mixed Value** (line 17: `trueval`)
   - "true" showing as orange (like integer)
   - Expected: blue (boolean color)
   - "val" correctly shown as error (red)

## Analysis

The boolean color issue suggests either:
1. Zed theme maps `@constant.builtin.boolean` to orange instead of blue
2. The boolean token is being captured with wrong highlight group
3. There's a precedence issue in the highlighting rules

## Recommendations

1. **Verify in Different Themes**: Test with multiple Zed themes to see if boolean color varies
2. **Check Parse Tree**: Verify that "true" in "trueval" is actually parsed as `(bool)` node
3. **Consider Theme Documentation**: Document expected colors for each token type

## Color Legend (Typical Zed Theme)
- Green: Strings/raw values
- Orange: Numbers/integers  
- Blue: Constants/booleans
- Red: Errors
- Gray: Comments
- White: Unrecognized/operators

## Conclusion

The parser is working correctly with all expected tokenization occurring. The only issue is a color mapping for booleans that appears orange instead of the expected blue. This may be theme-specific rather than a parser issue.
