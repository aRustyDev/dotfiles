# Phase 2: String Types Verification File
# Open this file in Zed with the env extension loaded to verify highlighting

# ====================
# DOUBLE QUOTED STRINGS
# ====================

# Basic double quotes
BASIC_DOUBLE="This is a simple string"
EMPTY_DOUBLE=""
SPACES_DOUBLE="  leading and trailing spaces  "

# Double quotes with special characters
SPECIAL_CHARS="Line with = equals and # hash symbols"
PATH_DOUBLE="/usr/local/bin/app"
URL_DOUBLE="https://example.com/path?param=value"

# ====================
# SINGLE QUOTED STRINGS  
# ====================

# Basic single quotes
BASIC_SINGLE='This is a simple string'
EMPTY_SINGLE=''
SPACES_SINGLE='  leading and trailing spaces  '

# Single quotes with special characters (literal)
NO_INTERPOLATION='${USER} and $HOME are literal here'
LITERAL_SINGLE='This has \n escape sequences \t as literals'

# ====================
# STRING INTERPOLATION (Double Quotes Only)
# ====================

# Simple interpolation
USER_GREETING="Hello ${USER}!"
HOME_PATH="Your home is: ${HOME}"
MULTIPLE_VARS="User ${USER} in ${HOME} directory"

# Short form interpolation
SHORT_FORM="Welcome $USER to the system"
MIXED_SHORT="Path: $HOME/documents"

# Interpolation with defaults
WITH_DEFAULT="${DATABASE_URL:-postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb}"
CUSTOM_DEFAULT="${APP_NAME:-MyApplication}"
NESTED_DEFAULT="Running ${APP_NAME:-MyApp} on ${PORT:-3000}"

# Complex interpolation
COMPLEX_MIX="Hello ${USER}, your path $PATH is ready"
URL_WITH_VAR="https://api.${DOMAIN:-example.com}/v1/users"

# ====================
# ESCAPE SEQUENCES
# ====================

# Escaped quotes in double quotes
ESCAPED_DOUBLE="She said \"Hello World\" to me"
MIXED_QUOTES="It's a \"beautiful\" day"

# Escaped characters
ESCAPED_NEWLINE="Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
ESCAPED_TAB="Column1\tColumn2\tColumn3"
ESCAPED_BACKSLASH="C:\\Users\\Documents\\file.txt"

# ====================
# EDGE CASES
# ====================

# Mixed quote styles on same line
QUOTE_MIX1="double" QUOTE_MIX2='single'

# Values that look like strings but aren't quoted
NOT_STRING=This is actually raw_value not a string
ALSO_RAW=true  # This is raw_value, not string

# String followed by comment
STRING_COMMENT="value" # This is a comment

# Strings containing quotes
CONTAINS_SINGLE="This has a ' single quote"
CONTAINS_DOUBLE='This has a " double quote'

# ====================
# HIGHLIGHTING EXPECTATIONS
# ====================
# 
# In Zed, you should see:
# - Variable names (left of =) in one color (variable.parameter)
# - Double quoted strings in string color (string.quoted.double)
# - Single quoted strings in string color (string.quoted.single)
# - ${VAR} and $VAR highlighted specially (variable.special)
# - Escape sequences like \n highlighted (constant.character.escape)
# - Comments in comment color
# - Raw values (unquoted) in a different color from strings
#
# Things to verify:
# 1. Interpolation only works in double quotes, not single
# 2. Escape sequences are highlighted in strings
# 3. ${VAR:-default} shows both the variable and default
# 4. Unquoted values are visually distinct from quoted strings
