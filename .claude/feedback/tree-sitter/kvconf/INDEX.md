## Q&A Documentation

### Developer Questions

**Q: Why use token.immediate instead of regular sequencing?**
A: The parser's lexer was entering an incorrect state after the '=' token, causing it to interpret the value as a new variable. token.immediate forces tight coupling between tokens, preventing this state transition.

**Q: Should we support section headers like INI files?**
A: Currently focusing on flat KEY=VALUE format. Section support could be added in a future phase if there's demand.

**Q: How do we handle conflicting value types?**
A: We use strict precedence: quoted strings always win, then booleans, integers, URIs, and finally raw values as catch-all.

**Q: What about multi-line values?**
A: Not currently supported. Most KEY=VALUE formats expect single-line values. Could be added for specific formats later.
