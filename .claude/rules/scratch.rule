- the project is controlled by justfile recipes
- api interactions use python scripts
- justfile recipes prefer just script patterns like `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over individual recipe lines
- each justfile recipe should be as modular as possible
- A recipe can have multiple attributes, the convention to use is to separate them by commas on the same line like `[no-cd, private]`
- All justfile recipes need a description line starting with `# `
  - use the description to explain what the recipe does
  - The recipe must be only 1 line long
- CI related scripts go in the `.ci/scripts` folder
  - `.ci/scripts/bash`: Bash Scripts
  - `.ci/scripts/python`: Python Scripts
  - `.ci/scripts/jq`: JQ Scripts
  - `.ci/scripts/awk`: AWK Scripts
- Non-CI related scripts go in `scripts/`
  - `scripts/bash`: Bash Scripts
  - `scripts/python`: Python Scripts
  - `scripts/jq`: JQ Scripts
  - `scripts/awk`: AWK Scripts
- TODO items are tracked in `.aim/todo/**/*.md` files
  - each TODO item should have a checkbox `- [ ]` at the start of the line
  - `.aim/todo/` has subfolders for different branches of work
    - `.aim/todo/refactor/`: refactoring work
    - `.aim/todo/chore/`: chore work
    - `.aim/todo/feat/`: new features
    - `.aim/todo/fix/`: new fixes
    - `.aim/todo/scratch/`: these are temporary TODOs that can be deleted later
  - All branch related subfolders in `.aim/todo/` have the following pattern
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>`: the "id" of the specific work branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/reference.json`: Links to related resources
      - Jira tickets
      - Documentation pages
      - GitHub/GitLab issues/PRs
      - Database tables to for shared project memories and MCP servers
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/MEMORY.md`: the memory file for this work branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/GOALS.md`: Specific GOALS for this work branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/SCOPE.md`: Specific SCOPE for this work branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/feedback/`: Current feedback documents
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/archive/`: Archived documents
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/plans/`: planning documents related to the branch
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/tasks/`: Unordered lists of things to do
    - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/lessons/`: Documented lessons learned
    - This pattern can be derived from the git branch name
      - Example `feat/adamsm/map-3421-cicd` would be stored in
        - `.aim/todo/feat/map-3421-cicd/`
      - Example `feat/adamsm/map-3421/core` would be stored in
        - `.aim/todo/feat/map-3421/core/`
