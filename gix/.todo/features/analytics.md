# Analytic Goals

**Code churn**: Files changed most frequently, hotspots needing refactoring
**Release planning**: Time between commits, commit patterns before releases
**Code ownership**: Who touches which files most, bus factor analysis
**Technical debt**: Large files, frequently modified files, commit message patterns
**Dependency analysis**: Which files are always changed together
**Developer collaboration**: Who works with whom, knowledge transfer paths
**Merge conflict prediction**: Files that conflict based on historical patterns
**Code flow**: How changes propagate through the codebase
**Influence networks**: Which commits/developers influence others
**Refactoring impact**: Ripple effects of changes through file dependencies
**Time-series analysis**: Commit velocity over time, seasonal patterns
**Large-scale aggregations**: Codebase growth, language distribution changes
**Performance analysis**: Build time correlation with code changes
**Statistical analysis**: Code complexity metrics, commit size distributions
**Flexible schema evolution**: Handle different Git metadata formats over time
**Multi-dimensional analysis**: Combine structured and unstructured data
**Complex relationships**: Document properties + graph relationships
**Event sourcing**: Track all changes with full audit trails
