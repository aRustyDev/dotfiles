# Epic: Transform git-setup to modern 1Password integration

## Overview

Transform the existing `git setup` command from a script that requires modifying 1Password's agent.toml to a modern implementation with standalone profile management.

## Problem Statement

The current `git_setup.sh` implementation has several issues:

1. **agent.toml Conflict**: Requires adding `name` fields to 1Password's agent.toml that must be commented out for 1Password to function
2. **Limited Profiles**: Only supports 4 hardcoded profiles (github, gitlab, work, home)
3. **Poor UX**: No way to add/edit/delete profiles without editing configuration files
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Complex dependencies and TOML parsing requirements

## Solution

Create a new implementation that:
- Stores profile mappings separately from 1Password configuration
- Provides interactive profile management
- Maintains the simple `git setup <target>` interface
- Works seamlessly with 1Password SSH agent

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Original functionality preserved in legacy directory
- [ ] MVP implementation completed and tested
- [ ] Advanced features implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation available
- [ ] Migration path documented and tested
- [ ] No modifications to agent.toml required
- [ ] All existing workflows supported

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (git-setup-v2)
- Basic profile CRUD operations
- Direct 1Password integration
- JSON-based storage
- Core git configuration

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Caching for performance
- Fuzzy profile matching
- Enhanced UI/UX
- Custom overrides

### Phase 3: Integration
- Nix-Darwin packaging
- Testing framework
- CI/CD integration
