## Rules

- **Engineering Principles**: Define overarching guidelines, such as preferred coding patterns, architectural styles (e.g., MVC or MVVM), and naming conventions.
- **Specific Do’s and Don’ts**: Provide detailed instructions for handling UI components, managing dependencies, or addressing project-specific nuances.
- **Project Constraints**: Outline limitations or requirements, including performance benchmarks, compatibility considerations, or platform-specific guidelines.
- **Be Specific**: Clearly define rules for architecture, coding patterns, and constraints. For example, specify whether to use MVVM or MVC and explain the reasoning behind your choice.
- **Document the “Why”**: Include the rationale for key decisions to provide context. This is particularly useful when revisiting older projects or onboarding collaborators.
- **Keep It Dynamic**: Treat the file as a living document. Regularly update it to reflect changes in your workflow, new constraints, or lessons learned from the development process.
- **Make It Accessible**: Ensure the file is easy to locate and reference within your project directory. This encourages consistent use and updates.
