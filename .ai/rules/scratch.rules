Be specific and clear:
        Avoid ambiguity—use precise language and define any technical terms.
        Specify the exact actions the AI should take to avoid any off-tangent behavior.
Provide context and background:
    Give the AI enough information to understand the task's purpose and importance.
    Explain the desired audience or use case for the output.
    For example, "Generate an expert-level keyword research report" tells the AI the expected quality and expertise level.
Define the output format:
    Specify the structure, style, and tone of the desired output.
    Use examples to illustrate the expected format.
    Define using natural language or Markdown structure with headings, tables, and specific sections is clearly defined.
Incorporate tool usage guidelines:
    Clearly state which tools the AI should use and how to use them.
    Provide examples of tool calls and expected inputs/outputs.
    Explain how to handle potential errors or missing data from tool calls.
Encourage iteration and refinement:
    Include instructions for how the AI should respond to user feedback or requests for further action.
    Allow the AI to ask clarifying questions if needed.
    The "Offer to Go Deeper" section in the example encourages further interaction and refinement of the research.
