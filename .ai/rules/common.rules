- project memory is held in the `.aim/` directory
  - `.aim/examples/`
  - `.aim/archive/`
  - `.aim/tools/`
  - `.aim/todo/`
  - `.aim/help/`
- TODO items are tracked in `.aim/todo/**/*.md` files
  - each TODO item should have a checkbox `- [ ]` at the start of the line
  - `.aim/todo/` has subfolders for different branches of work
    - `.aim/todo/refactor/`: refactoring work
    - `.aim/todo/chore/`: chore work
    - `.aim/todo/feat/`: new features
    - `.aim/todo/fix/`: new fixes
    - `.aim/todo/scratch/`: these are temporary TODOs that can be deleted later
- All branch related subfolders in `.aim/todo/` have the following pattern
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>`: the "id" of the specific work branch
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/reference.json`: Links to related resources
    - Jira tickets
    - Documentation pages
    - GitHub/GitLab issues/PRs
    - Database tables to for shared project memories and MCP servers
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/MEMORY.md`: the memory file for this work branch
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/GOALS.md`: Specific GOALS for this work branch
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/SCOPE.md`: Specific SCOPE for this work branch
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/feedback/`: Current feedback documents
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/archive/`: Archived documents
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/plans/`: planning documents related to the branch
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/tasks/`: Unordered lists of things to do
  - `.aim/todo/<branch>/<id>/lessons/`: Documented lessons learned
  - This pattern can be derived from the git branch name
    - Example `feat/adamsm/map-3421-cicd` would be stored in
      - `.aim/todo/feat/map-3421-cicd/`
    - Example `feat/adamsm/map-3421/core` would be stored in
      - `.aim/todo/feat/map-3421/core/`
