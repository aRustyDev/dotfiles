Memory (Default): Persistent Memory
- Use the Graphiti MCP Server for all persistent memory:
  - Namespace: `{PROJECT_ID}::` from `git config --get project.id`
  - Store preferences/configs as entity attributes
  - Store decisions/architecture as entities with relationships
  - Embed document content for semantic search
  - Create temporal relationships (when decisions were made)
  - Search with hybrid mode: `search(query, project_filter)`
  - Session start:
    - Query `{PROJECT_ID}::*` entities for context
    - Use `whoami` to identify the current user
       - Create or retrieve user profile from the knowledge graph
  - Session end: Add new decisions/learnings as entities
  - NEVER access entities outside current project namespace
  - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"
