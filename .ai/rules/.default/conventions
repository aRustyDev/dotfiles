- the project is controlled by justfile recipes
- api interactions use python scripts
- justfile recipes prefer just script patterns like `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over individual recipe lines
- each justfile recipe should be as modular as possible
- A recipe can have multiple attributes, the convention to use is to separate them by commas on the same line like `[no-cd, private]`
- All justfile recipes need a description line starting with `# `
  - use the description to explain what the recipe does
  - The recipe must be only 1 line long
- CI related scripts go in the `.ci/scripts` folder
