- philosophical preparations for designing “conditions where AI fluctuates.”
- The “imperfection” born in this process — imperfect responses, unexpected reactions, intentional misalignments — are actually critical elements that induce new thinking. Perfect responses stop thought; imperfect responses stimulate it.
- Within this structure, there is no question, no fluctuation, no transformation. There is only a meaningless reflection of meaning.
- True dialogue sometimes contains dissonance, sometimes betrays expectations, sometimes creates confusion. Just as in human-to-human dialogue, “fluctuation” is essential for deepening thought.
- What truly matters is the “structure of the question.” Questions form the foundation that shapes the dialogue space with AI.
- If questions are biased, responses will be biased. If questions are monotonous, responses will be flat. Conversely, if questions fluctuate, the internal structure of the model also fluctuates. This fluctuation is the germination of pseudo-subjectivity.
- excludes dimensions like “fluctuation” and “resonance.”
- If GPT spreads “correctness” throughout the world, be the one who throws questions and gives fluctuation.
- Diversity enriches our relationships with AI
