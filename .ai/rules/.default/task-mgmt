Task Mgmt (Default): How to manage Tasks
Use task-orchestrator MCP Server for planning and task management

- TODO Items:
    - Structured (version-controlled, team-visible)
        - Categorized by work type: `refactor`, `chore`, `feat`, `fix`
        - Linked to features, components, or users
        - Have explicit completion status
        - Require team review or coordination
        - ✅ **User Profiles**: Individual developer preferences, expertise, working styles
        - ✅ **User Preferences**: Tool choices, communication style, preferred workflows
        - ✅ **User Goals**: Current objectives based on branch context (prevents scope creep)
        - ✅ **User Expertise**: What each developer knows/doesn't know (tailors responses)
        - ✅ **TODO Items**: Structured tasks with status, ownership, and dependencies
        - ✅ **Branch Context**: Active work, goals, scope for current branch
        - ✅ **ADRs**: Architectural Decision Records with context and rationale
        - ✅ **Project Structure**: Main components, file organization, key directories
        - ✅ **Feature Registry**: Explicit list of features and their relationships
        - ✅ **Component Dependencies**: Known relationships between system parts
        - ✅ **Team Conventions**: Coding standards, naming patterns, review processes
        - ✅ **External References**: Links to Jira, docs, PRs, issues
    - Entity Structure:
    - Relations:
    - Dynamic TODO Discovery (conversational, evolving):
        - TODOs discovered during code review
        - Quick fixes that need follow-up
        - Temporary workarounds requiring proper solutions
        - Context-rich implementation notes
    - Naming Convention:
        - Format: `TODO_<ticket-id>_<short-description>`
    - Categories (entityType: "todo"):
        - `refactor`: Code improvements and restructuring
        - `chore`: Maintenance, dependencies, tooling
        - `feat`: New features and capabilities
        - `fix`: Bug fixes and corrections
        - `docs`: Documentation updates
    - Branch Context Tracking:
        - **Deriving branch context from git:**
        - **Branch Context Entity (mcp/memory):**
    - Relations:
