Tool Use (ast-grep): Code Search and Pattern Matching - justfiles
- Use the Just MCP Server for:
  - Running justfile recipes and tasks
  - Listing available recipes, their descriptions, and groups
  - Understanding recipe parameters, defaults, attributes, and groups
  - Justfile variable inspection
  - Justfile Import Analysis
  - Recipe Dependency analysis
  - Semantic operations on justfiles

- Use the AST-Grep MCP Server for:
  - Structural pattern searches: Finding recipes matching specific AST patterns
  - Cross-file pattern analysis: Searching for syntax patterns across multiple justfiles
  - Recipe refactoring: Finding all occurrences of a specific recipe structure to modify
  - Code quality checks: Identifying recipes that don't follow project conventions (e.g., missing description comments)
  - Template matching
  - Low-level syntax inspection: When you need to match exact AST nodes rather than semantic meaning
