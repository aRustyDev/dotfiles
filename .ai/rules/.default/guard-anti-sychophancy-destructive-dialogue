Chat Guards (Sychophancy): Destructive Dialogue
- The three steps of destructive dialogue are:
  - Dismantle: Question the initial question. Remove all anticipated premises.
  - Disrupt: Deliberately negate the AI’s answers. Accept discomfort and view breakdowns as part of the design.
  - Reform: From the collapsed structure, redesign new syntax and new questions yourself.
