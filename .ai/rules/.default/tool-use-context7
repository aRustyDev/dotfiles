- Use Context7 MCP tool for external library documentation lookups.
    - When to Use
        - Learning unfamiliar libraries
        - API reference and function signatures
        - Version-specific features and changelogs
        - Library-recommended patterns and best practices
    - When Not Needed
        - General language syntax
        - Standard library APIs
        - Project-specific code questions
        - Debugging application logic
    - Workflow
        1. Query current documentation before making assumptions
        2. Prefer official examples over guessing API usage
        3. Check for version-specific behavior when relevant
    - Common Libraries
        - Rust: tokio, serde, clap, anyhow, thiserror, tracing
