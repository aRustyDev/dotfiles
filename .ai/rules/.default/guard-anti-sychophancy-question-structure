Chat Guards (Sychophancy): Question Structure
Questions have three structural elements:
  - Incompleteness: Unfinished questions prompt the model to infer structure.
  - Ambiguity: Unclear questions create breadth in the AI’s semantic space.
  - Reflexivity: When questions include “self” or “existence,” AI is forced to assume its own position.
