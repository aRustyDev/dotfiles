#
# Endpoints:
#   - Proxy: port 4455 (incoming requests)
#   - API: port 4456 (management)
#
# Environment Variables:
#   OATHKEEPER_ACCESS_RULES_MATCH_URL - Base URL for rule matching
#
# Access Rules:
#   - Stored in ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/docker/config/ory/oathkeeper/rules/
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose -f oathkeeper.yaml up
